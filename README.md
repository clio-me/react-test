# Clio's "Bookmarked Movies" Frontend Test

## Purpose 
This problem will be used to showcase your understanding of React, Frontend Architecture, State management, general 
use of best-practises and git practices.

It is mandatory to use React as the frontend library, but you are allowed to use any other 
third-party library that will help your solution showcase your skills, however keep in mind that simplicity is beauty.


## Problem statement
We ask you to create a small React application that follows the specifications defined in this [design specification](instructions/instructions.md).

We ask you to maintain a clean and structured git log.

The application created should contain a README.md file that clearly states how to run and play with the project. 
You can also utilise the README.md to discuss what you would have liked to implement if more time had been available.

## Delivery
We expect you to deliver a solution within 3 days. 
Please let us know that you require more time if this does not fit with your schedule.

You can either fork or create a (preferably) private repository and your point of contact will 
send you a list of emails you can add as collaborators for review purpose.s

We ask you to not keep your solution public longer than strictly necessary for this review process.

## Thank you!
Thank you for your interest in Clio and committing your valuable time! We will strive to give developer 
feedback within two days.
