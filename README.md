# Clio's "Bookmarked Movies" Frontend Test

## Purpose

This problem will be used to showcase your understanding of React, Frontend Architecture, State management, and general
use of best practices and git practices.

It is mandatory to use React. You are allowed to use additional third-party libraries
that could help you showcase your skills, however, keep in mind that simplicity is beauty.

## Problem statement

We ask you to create a small React application that follows the specifications defined in this [design specification](instructions/instructions.md).

We ask you to maintain a clean and structured git log.

Your solution should contain a README.md file that clearly states how to run and play with the project.
You can also utilize the README.md to discuss what you would have liked to implement if more time had been available.

## Delivery

We expect you to deliver a solution within 3 days.
Please let us know if you require more time in case this does not fit your schedule.

You can either fork or create a (preferably) private repository. Your point of contact will
send you a list of emails you can add as collaborators for review purposes.

We ask you not to keep your solution public longer than strictly necessary for the review process.

## Thank you!

Thank you for your interest in Clio and for committing your valuable time! We will strive to give our
feedback within two days.
